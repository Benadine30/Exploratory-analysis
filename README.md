# Exploratory-analysis
This is an exploration of Adidas sales performance to get a few insights
 This is an analysis of the entire Adidas sales in the US from January 2020 to December 2021. My main aim was to find out key insights like total sales, profit, no of units sold, best-selling states and products, etc.

My Observations are:
They had a total of $900m in sales for this period of one year and 11 months. 2021 alone generated about 79.77% of this total sales.
So I think it’s safe to say Covid-19 affected their sales in 2020.

They had their highest sales in the 3rd quarter of 2021, precisely July and they dropped a little in the fourth quarter.

Men’s street footwear sold the highest number of units with about 593320 and it's mainly through online sales. Maybe because shopping online is a lot easier and Men wears sneaker more and also visits the gym more than women.

The New York State generated the highest sales.

Men’s footwear sells more but Women’s apparel generates more revenue.
